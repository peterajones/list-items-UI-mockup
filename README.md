### NOTE:
I built this using React.

The following are the tasks to complete.

## Tasks to complete
1. - [x] Create a template for the structure depicted in the mock-ups (see workfiles).
2. - [x] Using CSS, style your template so it matches the mock-ups as closely as possible.
3. - [x] Create a list component from your code and import it to the project.
4. - [x] Display system's current date in the format shown in the mock-ups.

6. - [x] Display the total number of new items as red badge in the list header.
7. - [x] Display default image placeholder if item is missing icon.
